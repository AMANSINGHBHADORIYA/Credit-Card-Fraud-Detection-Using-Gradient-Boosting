# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Using-Gradient-Boosting
The purpose of this code is to train a machine learning model (specifically a gradient boosting classifier) to classify data instances into different classes based on their features. 

#Data Preprocessing:

#Missing Value Imputation: 

The code handles missing values in the target variable (y_train) using the SimpleImputer class from scikit-learn. Missing values are imputed with a constant value (e.g., 0).

Feature Scaling (Optional): The code scales the feature variables (X_train and X_test) using the StandardScaler from scikit-learn. Feature scaling ensures that all features have a similar scale, which can improve the performance of some machine learning algorithms.
Model Training:

Model Selection: The code imports and initializes the HistGradientBoostingClassifier from scikit-learn. This classifier is a variant of gradient boosting that uses histograms for efficient training.
Model Fitting: The initialized model is trained on the preprocessed training data (X_train and y_train_imputed) using the fit() method.
Model Evaluation:

Prediction: The trained model is used to generate predictions (y_pred) on the test data (X_test).
Evaluation Metrics: Several evaluation metrics are computed to assess the performance of the model:
Accuracy Score: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances among all instances in the test set.
Confusion Matrix: Provides a tabular summary of actual vs. predicted class labels, showing the count of true negatives, false positives, false negatives, and true positives.
Classification Report: Summarizes key classification metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for each class, along with support (the number of occurrences of each class).
Visualization: A scatter plot is created to visualize the distribution of data points in a 2-dimensional feature space, with colors representing different target classes.
Purpose:

The purpose of this code is to train a machine learning model (specifically a gradient boosting classifier) to classify data instances into different classes based on their features.
By preprocessing the data, training the model, and evaluating its performance, the code aims to build a predictive model that can accurately classify unseen instances.
Additionally, visualization techniques such as the scatter plot provide insights into the distribution of data and the relationships between features and target classes, aiding in model interpretation and understanding.
